# Reading-List-Manager

I wrote this application for my final project in my Advanced C# course in college.  It's a WinForms app with C# driving it.  The database
I used is MS Access.  I made this choice due to availability of the software and my recent exposure to it.  There is some SQL in the
access DB.  This project showcases my knowledge of C#, good coding practices, WinForms, and SQL.

The intuitive interface lets you view and edit your list of books.  It can be sorted by any of its columns or it can display only read or
only unread books.  There is a section that allows you to add new books to your list.  There is a feature to randomly suggest a book from 
your list of unread books.  Finally, there is a pop up that will display various stats about your reading habits.
